# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project was to process and analyze two datasets, and get insights that could help the managment in making decisions, we did this by creating a summary data frame that shows ride-sharing data by city type and by creating a multiple-line graph with Matplotlib that shows the total weekly fares for each city type that helps understand all the information with ease.

## Results

From the data extracted we could create the following summary data frame:

As we can see, there is a significant decrease in Total Rides and Total Drivers depending on the city type, this may be just the result of the demand ech city type have. The Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver is significantly greater in rural cities, this may be because the supply of drivers is not enough for the amount of rides this cities have.

In the following chart we can see the Total Fare for each City Type per week between June and May of 2019:

As we can see, the first two weeks of the year we had a dip in the amount of fare recollected for all city types, and we had a spike in recollected fare in the 3th week of february that was kept for Urban cities for two more weeks but that stopped for Suburban and Rural cities.

## Summary

Based on insight of this analysis we make the following recommendations:

- Increase the amount of drivers for rural cities in order to satisfy the demand of rides and decrease the fare price. This may result in a increase in the amount of rides.
- Increase the amount of drivers for the 3th week of february to satisfy the apparently higher demand in this week of the year.
- Decrease the amount of drivers for the first 2 weeks of the year to satisfy the apparently lower demand at the beginning of the year.
